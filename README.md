# MORTHELPER

Not being fully happy with the mortgage breakdown helpers I found online, and having failed achieving what I wanted using spreadsheets, I tried with Clojure and I got what I wanted done in a few hours.

Mostly, I wanted a single way to see a breakdown for mortgages with an initial deal period+rate.

Use at your own risk.
